### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: Philosophers from which prefer long sentences
+ This project is conducted by Yiming Zhu

+ Project summary: I wonder if the different teaching methods in different schools will affect the language models of philosophers. For example, some colleges choose textbooks, so philosophers in that college tend to choose longer philosophical sentences. To investigate this question, I choose two schools that I am interested most, analytic and aristotle.
